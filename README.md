# Media Marginalia #

"Marginalia are scribbles, comments and illuminations in the margins of a book." [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia)

Media Marginalia is a Wordpress Plugin that takes the concept of textual marginalia and applies it to video and audio.

It provides an interface to create/read/update/delete multi-media (text/video/audio) annotations for a given media file (video/audio).
